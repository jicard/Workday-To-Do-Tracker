# <Workday Planner App>

## Description

This is a basic web app designed to help a user organize their day into activities to complete per hour, using standard business hours of 9am-5pm. 

This project displays my applied knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. 

## Usage

On initial load, the page shows you the current date and time. Type your "to-do's" into the corresponding hour's text box, then click the Disk icon to save the text to localStorage. Refresh the page, and your data is retained!
